### Part 1: Console-based Program with Menu Options

You are creating a console-based program that allows the user to view a list of numbers and perform a few calculations. This program will present a menu with three (3) options, and the menu should be created with a do-while loop. Ensure the user knows what to type for each option.

#### Menu Options

**Option 1**: Display a List of 20 Numbers

1. Prompt the user for a starting number.
2. Use a `for` loop to generate and display a list of 20 numbers starting from the specified number.
   - Multiply even numbers by 3.
   - Multiply odd numbers by 4.
3. Sum all the results and display the total.

**Option 2**: Division by 3

1. Prompt the user for a number.
2. Use a `while` loop to display the result of the number divided by 3.
3. Repeat until the user types "END" to return to the main menu.

**Option 3**: Exit the Program

1. Exit the program gracefully.

#### Additional Requirements

- Invalid options should prompt the menu to reappear.
- String entries where numeric values are expected should not crash the program.
- Encapsulate the logic of options 1 and 2 within their own methods.
- Proper error handling.
- Adhere to coding standards as described in the course.
- Ensure clarity in user prompts.

### Part 2: Four Number Calculator Console Application

Create a separate C# Console Application project named `A3<initials>P2`. For example, a student with team members John Smith and Bill Anderson would name their project `A3JSBAP2`.

#### Functionality

This application will act as a simple four-number calculator using console input.

1. Prompt the user to select a mathematical operation: Add (1), Multiply (2), Subtract (3), Divide (4).
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of values (1 to 4) for the calculation.
3. Perform the selected operation:
   - **Addition**: Sum all numbers.
   - **Subtraction**: Subtract each number from the previous one.
   - **Multiplication**: Multiply all numbers.
   - **Division**: Divide the first number by the second number (only allow 2 numbers).
4. Display the result and any error messages.
5. The program runs once and then exits.

#### Error Handling

- Implement try/catch statements to handle errors.
- Display at least 3 different types of error or status messages.
- Ensure the program does not crash due to user errors.
